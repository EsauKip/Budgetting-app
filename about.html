                too.

                    <h4>No Individual Investment Advice</h4>
                    The Budgetting App does not provide individual or customized legal, tax, accounting, or investment services. Since each individual's situation is unique, a qualified professional should be consulted before making financial decisions.

                    <h4>Diversity & Inclusion</h4>
                    The Budgetting App is committed to answering your money spending questions. But we know many of the answers do not include solutions for readers underserved by the financial industry and financial publishing community. There are more complex challenges
                    facing our Black, Indigenous, and other Readers of Color, and we must address these challenges in our content or we fail our core mission. Our pledge to improve diversity & inclusion outlines actions we will take to fulfill our commitment
                    to all of our application users.</p>
